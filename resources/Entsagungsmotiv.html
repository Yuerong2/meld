<p>Wagner's technique of using 'leitmotifs' to construct musical form as well as to constitute and convey musical meaning has received a rich and varied reception. Leitmotif analysis makes up a major strand of Wagner research, but leitmotif interpretation is not only an academic phenomenon: especially surrounding the premiere of the Ring des Nibelungen, a genre of explanatory and introductory literature developed, which promoted the 'understanding' of Wagner's music through identifying, naming and 'understanding' leitmotifs. </p>

<p>The varying ways in which 'leitmotifs' are constructed and presented within these 'leitmotif guides' each express a particular understanding of both the concept of 'leitmotifs' in general and their functioning as a compositional technique, as well as of the individual leitmotifs, which can differ considerably from Wagner's own conception. The name that is assigned to a leitmotif, for instance, not only fixes its semantic reference, determining its dramatic potential and influencing the interpretation of its musical function, but it also implies a certain relationship between motive and name, as well as, more generally, between music and language. </p>

<p>Similarly, the notation examples that are given to identify the motif's musical shape vary considerably between different guidebooks, and the differences, although they might seem minor at first sight, are indicative of different conceptions of the phenomenon leitmotif: they display the perspective of the author and influence the 'picture' or impression of the specific motive, the motive technique in general, and the entire work that a particular guide conveys to its readers. </p>

<p>One example is the musical structure that first occurs when Woglinde explains to Alberich that the Ring made from the Rheingold that gives its holder power over the world can only be forged by someone who refuses or renounces love.  </p>

<p>A comparison of how this passage is represented in three different leitmotif guides (Hans von Wolzogen: Thematischer Leitfaden durch die Musik zu Richard Wagners Festspiel Der Ring des Nibelungen, Leipzig: Schloemp, 1876, p. 23; Hans von Wolzogen, Guide through the music of Richard Wagner's 'The Ring of the Nibelung', transl. by Ernst von Wolzogen, London 1882, p. 13-14; Gustav Kobb&eacute;, Wagner's Music Dramas Analysed with the Leading Motives, New York: Schirmer, 1904, p. 11-12; S.H. Hamer, The Story of the Ring, London: Cassell and Company, 1907, p. 4) shows differences on several levels, that are insightful for the respective interpretation that stands behind it. </p>

<p><a name="Entsagungsmotiv">Wolzogen's notation presents the motive as a single line, isolating the voice of Woglinde and including the text that accompanies its first presentation. He identifies as the motive a short figure of five notes, but shows it to be part of a bigger 'formula', and thus shows the motive within the context in which it is introduced.</a> Although the notation example does not provide any details of accompaniment, Wolzogen's description that precedes the notation example mentions both that the 'formula' is played by Tubas and Trombones, and that it thereby effects a sharp contrast in timbre and atmosphere. The notation example also emphasizes the close connection between the 'Entsagungsmotiv', and the 'Ringmotiv', which he presents as intimately connected in what he calls the 'Entsagungsformel'. </p>

<p>Gustav Kobb&eacute;, an American music critic whose books about Wagner and his works were published in many different versions and editions in the USA and the UK, and who dedicated many of his writings to the musical education of a broad public, represents this musical passage entirely differently. <a name="Renunciation">Like Wolzogen, he only represents the melodic line, but the musical figure that he designates as the 'Motive of Renunciation' is only a shorter phrase, and he gives no indication that it is part of any bigger context. He also does not include any indication of accompaniment or instrumentation into the written description. Moreover, Kobb&eacute; omits the text, giving no indication that the first presentation of this motive occurs in the singing voice rather than the orchestra. </a></p>

<p>Sam Hield Hamer, editor with the publishing house Cassell and Company and, apart from this guidebook to the Ring, author of children's books, displays yet another approach towards representing the leitmotifs he identifies as notation. He quotes a longer passage (both iterations of what both Wolzogen and Kobb&eacute; identify as the core motive), and designates it as the 'Motive of Compulsion' (the semantic allocation is, too, distinctly different from the other two guides). Furthermore, his notation example does not only contain the vocal line, but also the instrumental accompaniment in the form of a piano reduction in some detail. However, even though he distinctly quotes the vocal line, he omits the text; - a general procedure in his guide, in which the text is only represented in a distincly simplified summary. </p>

<p>Apart from this, neither Kobb&eacute;'s nor Wolzogen's nor Hamer's notation examples follow a strictly systematic approach. There are other motives for which the notation examples include parameters that are here omitted (such as accompaniment, or, in Kobb&eacute;'s case, text). This means that the particular representations are a result of conscious decisions that reflect the individual understanding of the motives, rendering them all the more insightful. </p>

<p>In each case, the notation expresses a particular understanding of the musical motive, and a particular conception of what a leitmotif is and how it is defined and characterised. Is the leitmotif in question a short, concise and rather abstract figure, or a complete phrase? Is it a melodic line, or an entire setting? Is the text an essential part of the motive or not? </p>

<p>In the case of Wolzogen, the text is considered as essential as it defines and concretizes the meaning of the motive â€“ his name, which is introduced not only as 'Entsagungsmotiv' but rather as 'Motiv der Entsagung von der Minne Macht und der Liebe Lust', derives exactly from the sung text. The textual unit is also the criterion that defines the extent of the notation example, that extends beyond the mere motive, and rather identifies or extracts the motives from within the whole sung phrase. Hamer's conception is equally grounded in the actual musical context of the first occurrence of this musical structure, but it emphasizes and includes different aspects and parameters. Although the text, as mentioned due to the general principles underlying his book, is omitted, the vocal line is represented, in addition to the instrumental accompaniment. The motive, thus, is considered to be not just the melody, but the whole musical structure: the harmonic progression, the accompaniment characterized by sustained chords and quavers in the timpani, etc. Kobb&eacute;'s presentation, by contrast, decisively abstracts from the musical context: the motive appears as an abstract, preconceived building block, and its first occurrence within the work is already its first variation. </p>
